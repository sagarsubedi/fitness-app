### Functionalities

1. **_Login_**:

   > On the login screen, users can enter their email and password, assuming they have an account. If the email or password is incorrect, an alert will pop up stating that the credentials are incorrect. If the credentials are correct, the user will be taken to the home screen.

2. **_Register_**:

   > On the login screen, user can also sign up if they do not have an account. They would use the same text boxes for email and password used for loggin in, but this time they will click on Register instead of log in. If the acocunt already exists, it will not let them register. If the account does not exist, it will create a new account and take them to the home screen.

3. **_Reset Password_**:

   > On the login screen, user can also choose to reset their password in case they forgot it and cannot log in anymore. In order to proceed with reseting their password, the user would have to enter their email address that has been registered and then click on the "Reset Password" button leaving the password field empty. The user will receive an email with the reset link to the same email address they provided in the email field. After opening that email, they will be allowed to change their password and login to the app.

4. **_Calculate BMI_**:

   > Once they are logged in, they will be shown a home screen where users can calculate their BMI. There are 4 fields. They would have to enter their weight, height, age and gender. Once they enter valid input (wrong input will trigger error and will be alerted in a pop-up), the BMI will be calculated and it will be displayed to the user

5. **_Get Calories Recommendation_**:

   > On the same screen, after entering valid inputs to the same set of input fields i.e. weight, height, age and gender, the user will be able to get their calories recommendation. The calories recommendation will be calculated based on the BMI result and will be displayed to the user.

6. **_Password Change_**:

   > Other than forgetting the password, users sometimes would simply like to change in. In this case, we have a change password functionality where users can change their password while they are logged in. They would simply have to enter the new password and confirm it by entering it again in the confirm password field. Once they click on the "Change Password" button, the password will be changed and the next time they login, they will have to use the new password.

7. **_Logout_**:
   > Once the user is done using the app, they can simply click on the logout button on the profile screen and they will be logged out of the app.
